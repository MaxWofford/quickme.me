# quickme.me

Ever find yourself searching for images, reaction gifs, or other static files for a heated online debate?

quickme.me is a quick way to store your most used static files with tags.

Just dump your files into a tagged folder: `public/funny/reaction_gif.png`, and quickly link to them at `example.com/funny`.

## Possible future features

* imgur uploading
* multi-tagging
* Or, you know, I'll probably work on something serious for once
